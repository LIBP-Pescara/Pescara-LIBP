-Information:  
		•  This airport was completely done from scratch, all 3d objects and textures are created by me.
		•  I used ONLY free softwares,to support other nice projects like Flightgear. For the 3d objects I used Blender (https://www.blender.org/), for textures I used GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/) and finally I got precise measurements using Google Earth (https://www.google.it/intl/it/earth/).
